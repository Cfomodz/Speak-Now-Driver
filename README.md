### 🚗 Break Language Barriers, Boost Your Tips! 🌍

Speak-Now-Driver is an open-source service that gives gig workers, like food delivery drivers, a dedicated phone number for real-time translated calls. No more struggling with language differences—just smooth, clear communication that enhances service, ratings, and even tips!

Speech-to-Text (STT) → Converts speech to text ✍️

Translation → Converts text to driver's language 🌐

Driver Responds → Message translated back 🔁
